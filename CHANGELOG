0.2.0

- Updated hook for compatibility with SDK 1.6.0+ (#59). 

0.1.9

 - Fixed import hook for compatibility with SDK 1.5.1+ (#50)

0.1.8

- A task queue with something other than a default queue can be accessed in your app under test now 
  (bugfix from #42)

0.1.7

- Added support for Google App Engine SDK 1.3.1 (#36).  Actually, the 3rd party lib support is identical 
  to what dev_appserver does now so future lib additions should work seamlessly.
- Worked around setuptools conflicts that may be introduced by globally installed eggs having the 
  google namespace, e.g. protobuf (#34).

0.1.6

- Added option --without-sandbox so that import hooks can be bypassed to 
  use coverage and other edge case modules.  Patch contributed by jgeewax (#26)

0.1.5

- Worked around SDK 1.2.5's way of aggressively adding logging handlers (#25). 
  Note that this still allows Nose to capture and report your app's log messages.
  Thanks to Jason H. Smith for the bug report and patch.

0.1.4

- Added support for Google App Engine SDK 1.1.9 (#18).  Thanks to Mahmoud Arram
  and hackerblinks for patches.
- Fixed a path issue that causes ImportError on Windows (#19).  Thanks to kveretennicov 
  for the patch.
- There is a more informative error now if tests run with something lower than 
  Python 2.5 (#14).

0.1.3

- Fixed bug in handling of modules shared between sandboxed and
  non-sandboxed code that caused sys.modules to be empty in sandbox
  (among other problems). Thanks to Kumar McMillan for the bug report
  (#2).
- Changed sys.path munging to ensure that libs that may be in google
  and system libraries are loaded from google's libdir. Thanks to
  Kumar McMillan for the bug report and patch (#6).
- Fixed bug in how the sandbox shared module set was maintained between
  entries into the sandbox, which could cause a cascade of import errors
  under certain arrangments of test and app code. Thanks to Kumar McMillan
  for the bug report (#7).
  
0.1.2

- Updated datastore handling to use a nosegae-specific datastore by
  default. This prevents the test run from clearing the default
  dev_appserver datastore, as would happen with earlier
  releases. Thanks to Andy for raising the issue.

0.1.1

- Updated self-test to use trestle so that the resulting documentation
  is more clear for end users.

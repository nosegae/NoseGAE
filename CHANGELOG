0.5.7
- Re-added code that removes GAE log handler. Thanks obmarg!

0.5.6
- Fixes issue #34 by reloading the google module instead of deleting it from
  sys.modules on setup.

0.5.5
- Fix for taskqueue queue.yaml discovery in the case of --gae-application values that contain yaml files
  example: --gae-application "dispatch.yaml,default/app.yaml,mod1/module.yaml" where queue.yaml is in default/

0.5.4
- Override module stub initialization based on SO post
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28166558/invalidmoduleerror-when-using-testbed-to-unit-test-google-app-engine

0.5.3
- Fix regression in automatic taskqueue stup initialization due to app_path becoming a list in 0.5.2
- Add Travis-CI configuration for automated testing so this won't happen again

0.5.2
- Accept multiple modules comma-delimited --gae-application (Issue #22) (see support/modules_example/runtests.sh)
- Prepend GAE lib directory to path instead of append (Issue #23)

0.5.1

- Populate os.environ['CURRENT_VERSION_ID'] using devappserver2's built in
  generation via the 
  google.appengine.tools.devappserver2.application_configuration.ModuleConfiguration
  instance that is part of the ApplicationConfiguration's modules list

0.4.1

- Fix issue with timezone mismatch discovered by viorelsfetea by importing
  google.appengine.tools.os_compat which explicitly sets the timezone to UTC
  so that datetime and time objects created in tests match the ones created
  in the appengine runtime.

0.4.0

- Huge rewrite to support dev_appserver2
- Remove --with-sandbox because it does not work with dev_appserver2
- Automatically configure a TestBed instance and inject it into the test code
  for ease of configuration

0.3.0

- Initial dev_appserver2 support for sdk 1.9.17 via Dmitry Sadovnychyi
  (https://github.com/sadovnychyi/NoseGAE/commit/3452d77cae4e02d536f7eb3907602e3f4ddff16d)

0.2.1

- Updated import for old_dev_appserver for SDK 1.9.1+ (ec4011d2102893569f4f88d7e6c40687cc99754a)
- Added default options patch from gregorynicholas (https://code.google.com/p/nose-gae/issues/detail?id=62)
- Moved code to https://github.com/Trii/NoseGAE since old google code repo is no longer maintained

0.2.0

- Updated hook for compatibility with SDK 1.6.0+ (#59). 

0.1.9

 - Fixed import hook for compatibility with SDK 1.5.1+ (#50)

0.1.8

- A task queue with something other than a default queue can be accessed in your app under test now 
  (bugfix from #42)

0.1.7

- Added support for Google App Engine SDK 1.3.1 (#36).  Actually, the 3rd party lib support is identical 
  to what dev_appserver does now so future lib additions should work seamlessly.
- Worked around setuptools conflicts that may be introduced by globally installed eggs having the 
  google namespace, e.g. protobuf (#34).

0.1.6

- Added option --without-sandbox so that import hooks can be bypassed to 
  use coverage and other edge case modules.  Patch contributed by jgeewax (#26)

0.1.5

- Worked around SDK 1.2.5's way of aggressively adding logging handlers (#25). 
  Note that this still allows Nose to capture and report your app's log messages.
  Thanks to Jason H. Smith for the bug report and patch.

0.1.4

- Added support for Google App Engine SDK 1.1.9 (#18).  Thanks to Mahmoud Arram
  and hackerblinks for patches.
- Fixed a path issue that causes ImportError on Windows (#19).  Thanks to kveretennicov 
  for the patch.
- There is a more informative error now if tests run with something lower than 
  Python 2.5 (#14).

0.1.3

- Fixed bug in handling of modules shared between sandboxed and
  non-sandboxed code that caused sys.modules to be empty in sandbox
  (among other problems). Thanks to Kumar McMillan for the bug report
  (#2).
- Changed sys.path munging to ensure that libs that may be in google
  and system libraries are loaded from google's libdir. Thanks to
  Kumar McMillan for the bug report and patch (#6).
- Fixed bug in how the sandbox shared module set was maintained between
  entries into the sandbox, which could cause a cascade of import errors
  under certain arrangments of test and app code. Thanks to Kumar McMillan
  for the bug report (#7).
  
0.1.2

- Updated datastore handling to use a nosegae-specific datastore by
  default. This prevents the test run from clearing the default
  dev_appserver datastore, as would happen with earlier
  releases. Thanks to Andy for raising the issue.

0.1.1

- Updated self-test to use trestle so that the resulting documentation
  is more clear for end users.
